# PowerPlanToggler

This is a very hastily-written Visual C# application that runs in the tray. Left/Right-clicking the icon will open a context menu listing all power plans available to the user, allowing them to choose one to quickly change the active power plan without navigating to the "Power Options" dialogue.
